Welcome to my Linux Learning Journey repository!  
Over the next 6 weeks, I’m diving deep into Linux as the foundation of my DevOps roadmap.  

This repo contains:  
- 📚 Weekly notes (concepts, commands, and learnings)  
- 🐧 Shell scripts I practice along the way  
- 📝 Cheat sheets for quick reference  
- ⚡ Mini-projects to apply what I learn  

I’m also sharing my progress weekly on LinkedIn and Hashnode — learning in public keeps me accountable and connected with the community.

## 📅 6-Week Roadmap  

### Week 1: Fundamentals & Basics ✅  
- Why Linux (open source, secure, no licensing cost)  
- Linux distros  
- Kernel vs Shell (types of shells: bash, sh, zsh, ksh)  
- File systems: ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs  
- Directory structure overview  
- Practiced commands:  
  - Users & sessions → who, w -f, who -b, pinky, finger, last  
  - System info → hostname, uptime  
  - Manual/help → man, <command> --help  
  - History → history, history -c, history -r (.bash_history)  
  - Shell info → echo $0, echo $SHELL  
  - Networking → ip addr, ifconfig, ping  
  - File operations → ls -l, ls -lt, ls -ld /etc, ls -il  
- Learned about file types (regular, directory, symlink, block, char, pipe, socket)  
- Understood permissions (user, group, others, ACL)

## 🛠️ Resources I’m Using  

- FreeCodeCamp Linux tutorials (YouTube)  
- Built-in `man` pages  


## 💡 Reflection  

Week 1 was all about understanding the fundamentals.  
Linux felt overwhelming at first, but the more I practiced commands, the more comfortable I became.
